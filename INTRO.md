Why Vote for APP Capital?

â€‹ APP Capital was founded by early Tron enthusiasts who believed in the Tron objective of decentralizing the internet. Our goal is to assist Tron in expanding its reach across the globe, thus, making it the smart contract blockchain of choice. In order to accomplish this feat, we are setting up a digital fund that covers blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and the Tron ecosystem. As our action plan states, with the help of our supporters, we will be providing professional digital content to educate blockchain enthusiasts who can potentially be Tron adopters. The primary objective is to add value to the Tron ecosystem. Being a Super Representative is not just about running a server, it is about leading the Tron movement. And TronNode-007 is ready to do just that!
